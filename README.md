Cable management

"Cable management" is a 2d puzzle game that challenges you to connect input cables to output ones to close the circuit. However, this won't be as easy as matching colors, as some inputs may have to be used more than once and some outputs will not have corresponding inputs, so you will have to use some of the patented "signal processing" gadgets to complete the levels.

Gadgets include:

* Nanotechnology Opposite Transistors
* Optimal Reverberators
* Automatic Nanocarbon Diminishers

HOW TO PLAY

Tutorials are included. They explain the basic mechanics and the gadgets.

Only mouse controls are needed to play the game.
